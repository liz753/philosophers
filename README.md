## Project Overview

The assignment is designed around Edsger Dijkstra's famous dining philosophers problem. 


## Divide and Conquer 
I got started with identifying the concepts that were new to me.

<ins>1. Research</ins>
*   concept of threads and mutexes

<ins>2. Code Structure</ins>
*   creating a Makefile that doesn't relink
*   creating a header file 

<ins>3. Implementation</ins>
*   set up gettime

## Result 

Here are examples of commands and their execution with my program: 


## Tips for 42 students 
*   you can add ```-fsanitize=thread```to your flags in your makefile to check if there are data races, however, I recommend to only use this flag during the evaluation since it causes a high CPU usage 
    

## What I learned 
- learn about concurrent programming
